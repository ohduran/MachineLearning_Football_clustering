# Football players' clustering with Machine Learning
_A Data Science analysis on season 2016-2017 Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atletico de Madrid players_

## Description
Using the sklearn.clusters library, and data from season 2016-2017 for players on the top 3 teams in LaLiga football league, I developed an algorithm that divides all players into four teams, and fine-tunes our approach to the sport by means of naming defenders, midfielders and forwards.

As a side note, it also gives evidence that Benzema may not be the forward is expected to be, but more of a 'facilitator'. This may give some light onto the eternal debate around what Benzema is useful for.
